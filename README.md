## Description
As monopoly companies control the flow of information and advertising of internet media, products, services, and social connection recommendations, more important than ever is the need for an open computational data market built off truth and trust. Connection presupposes identity, a net of presences: in 2025 most names are claimed across namespaces including social media platforms and domain providers themselves. There is ambiguity in a consistent naming protocol that allows a bridge between a new unexplored digital realm and the existing incumbents where the world and our family and friends remain.
## Problem
Social media platforms have conflicts of interest discouraging user freedom and flexibility. As public companies they’re inclined to maximize shareholder value by locking in their users to drive revenue. The internet itself is an open place and the misalignment of the “fake internet” we all use today is clear and apparent. If we can’t fully exist on a new open secure protocol, we can’t extend and reify our tools, our personal brands, and our quality of connection.
## Approach
Three times three equals nine.  So simple that a 5-year-old can understand, “Three”“Ex”“Three”“Nine” (3x39) is a reset to the entire namespace of the internet. By simply appending “3x39” to just about every and any username on the internet – from your personal name to your alternative name to your organization name or publication name – you can likely claim unambiguous ownership of usernames and domains across nearly all internet platforms and levels. The design choice of the 3x39 username suffix offers flexibility for internationalization and artistry in a short, succinct, virtually unambiguous pronounceable way. The benefit also extends to choices of names for content delivery network providers and internet libraries.
